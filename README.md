# isyourserver.online? 
Our non-profit group is dedicated to hosting a server status website for the popular game minecraft. Our goal is to provide a platform for gamers to easily check if their favorite server is online and how many players are currently online. We believe this is particularly important for players who rely on servers to organize events and tournaments.

Our website also has a list of servers, and it is also possible to add your own server. In addition, we also offer tools for server owners to report their current status.

We strive to keep our website up to date and accurate, and we work closely with the online gaming community to continually improve the functionality and usability of our website. We believe that our website is a valuable tool for the online gaming community and we are committed to continuing to provide this service free of charge.
